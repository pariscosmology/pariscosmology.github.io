  <h1>Paris Cosmology Meetings</h1>
  <h2> About PaCo</h2>
  <p>First established in 2022, the goal of the PaCo meetings is to regularly bring together cosmologists in the Paris region
  for talks, discussions and the stimulation of new collaborations.</p>

  <p>The meetings take place for one afternoon every 3-4 months, hosted in turn by one of the participating institutes.</p>

  <p>Each meeting consists of an opening talk by an invited speaker, followed by a coffee break,
  short contributed talks and a social gathering.</p>

  <p> "Paco" is the diminutive form of the name "Francisco" in Spanish, meaning "Frenchman". </p>
